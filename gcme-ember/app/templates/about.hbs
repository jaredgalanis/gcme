  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
  The data in the Glossarial Database was compiled, lemmatized, and tagged by the late Larry D. Benson (1929-2015),
  Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English at Harvard University, from the text published under his editorship as
  <em>The Riverside Chaucer</em> (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1987) as well as the text of <em>The English Works of John Gower</em>,
  ed. G. C Macaulay, 2 vols. Early English Text Society, Extra Series, 81-2 (1900-1).
  Headwords are lemmatized (normalized) to conform to the headwords in The Middle English Dictionary, ed. Hans Kurath et al.
  ( (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1952â€”).

  <p>
  The Concordance is now limited to the works of Chaucer and the English works of Gower but there are plans for expansion.
